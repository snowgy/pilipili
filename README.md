## Three Features We have Chosen

### Login/Signup
Registration and login features are an essential part of the community. Users sign up to become a member of the Pilipili community, then log in t upload their own created photos or videos for sharing in the community or view and like photos or videos shared by others. Moreover, the feature is independent of the main function of Pilipili: photo or video is recreated through art filters. In addition, the constructing test cases of this feature is easy. Since most apps have this feature, there are a lot of test cases written by developers for reference and learning.
### Album

Album feature has been chosen since it is one of the important parts of Philip's main function. Pilipili belongs to a photographing tool, it should be able to display the users' album. We have roughly implemented the feature of viewing a photo album. The ease of constructing test cases also becomes the reason why we choose it because neatly and successfully display the pictures is what we concern. 

### File Description

Great masterpiece are indispensable to the stories and creative ideas behind the works. When users are attracted by the work, they need to know more information including author's description and other users' comments of it. The above description gives us the key reason for choosing this feature. File description feature is implemented as a page, cases are constructed to test whether page resources are able to show successfully and back to Home page.
